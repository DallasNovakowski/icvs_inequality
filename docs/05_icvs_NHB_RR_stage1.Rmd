  A growing body of evidence suggests that economic inequality causes humans to take more risks and engage in aggressive behaviours (Payne, et al., 2017). In a ?winner-takes-all? environment, risky activities such as gambling, lying, and crime can be a person's only means of keeping up with competitors and accessing contested resources. 
  
  There is comparitively little research investigating whether people anticipate risk-taking and conflict from their neighbors in unequal environments. An informative context for examining the fear-provoking effect of inequality is the security market, which offers goods that protect customers from the actions of malicious agents. For instance, barred windows are purchased because they (purportedly) protect consumers from break-ins. Given the costly nature of these security products, security consumption can only be worthwhile if a consumer expects that other people have harmful intentions. 
  
  The proposed research will examine whether inequality will increase consumers' willingness to purchase security products through two studies: 1) manipulations of inequality and distributional fairness in an economic game context, and 2) multilevel analysis of the International Crime Victimization Survey, a cross-national survey, totaling n = 52,909 respondents? experiences with crime, policing, crime prevention, and feelings of unsafety. Together, this project seeks to test the fear-provoking mechanism of inequality, and assess whether a country's income inequality is associated with individual-level consumption of security goods.

Seeking protection against rivals and enemies has consistently attracted humans' interest and resources. Despite worldwide crime rates generally decreasing [@unitednations2017], demand for security products, such as alarm systems, is growing (projected to increase 29% between 2021 and 2025; [@marketsandmarkets2021]. The choice to purchase security goods thus represents a substantial, and poorly understood, allocation of resources.

## Security and (dis)trust

Products that (purportedly) improve security are one of the few goods that confer little intrinsic value to consumers. Whereas vacations are inherently satisfying, the costs of burglar alarms, sturdy locks, and security cameras are only worthwhile *if consumers expect that other agents will cause them harm*. People's choice to consume security products is therefore an economically and socially relevant reflection (or consequence) of distrust in day-to-day life [@schul2008; @hardin2006; @mcevily2012].

Some evidence suggests that people can be overly distrustful. @mcevily2012 found that in a behavioural distrust game, participants tended to spend too much money to prevent their partner from keeping large sums of shared wealth. Paradoxically, security consumption can even *increase* one's vulnerability to victimizations. Surveying South African suburbs and security practitioners, @marks2015 found that households surrounded with high walls have obstructed lines of sight to and from the property, reducing the effectiveness of police patrols and "natural surveillance" by neighbors.

There is a blurred line between prudence and paranoia. As history has proved, one of the largest threats to people is other humans; other humans (via murder) are only outranked by mosquitoes as the deadliest animal to modern Homo sapiens [@gates2014]. Likewise, social life carries the risk of property crimes and defection in collective action problems (e.g., commitments to monogamy, business contracts). Humans' sociality carries enormous benefits to individuals, including life-saving aid in times of need, high levels of skill specialization, and access to skills and knowledge gained by others [@henrich2001]. Given the substantial benefits and risks of social interaction, when will a person spend their limited time, money, and opportunities protecting themselves from other people?

## Inequality and Distrust

Despite inequality increasing within countries [@saez2016], there is little research examining whether inequality causes people to *expect* desperation and risk-taking, and become distrustful of others. Although the field of study is relatively underdeveloped, a relationship between inequality and reduced social trust has been consistently observed in national and international studies [@knack1997], [@zak2001], [@berggren2006], [@leigh2006],[@bj√∏rnskov2007], and [@wilkinson2010] [@elgar2010; @barone2016; @decourson2021].

Although scholarly work in the area remains in its early stages, multiple theoretical streams have emerged to explain how inequality reduces trust. These mechanisms range from from changes in intergroup contact, opportunity costs of vigilance, and incentives for antisocial behaviour [reviewed in @jordahl2007]. However, this project's theoretical approach is not concerned with changes in the immediate payoffs of antisocial behaviour, but rather with how inequality changes people's preferences over these incentives.

A simulation study shows that in unequal environments, individuals unable to meet their need thresholds will try to exploit cooperative groups, leading others to eventually avoid cooperation altogether [@decourson2021]. These results are consistent with risk-sensitivity theory [RST, @caraco1980], which suggests that organisms will take risks when more predictable strategies cannot meet the organism's goals (e.g., starvation thresholds). The results in @decourson2021 were obtained through assumptions of the cascading effects of poverty. Through so-called compositional effects of inequality, unequal environments increase rates of poverty, leading to risky (and sometimes antisocial) behaviours. Over time, individuals who are not desparate will then choose to forego the potential benefits of cooperation in order to avoid potential exploitation.

## Inequality and security consumption: an Envy Anticipation Hypothesis

This project seeks to test the hypothesis that inequality increases security consumption (and distrust) because people expect their partners to experience envy/inequality aversion/relative deprivation. This proposed mechanism, which we call envy anticipation, is specific to predicting reduced trust towards relatively less wealthy individuals among comparators.

### Inequality and risk

A growing body of evidence suggests that economic inequality leads to increased risk-taking and conflict in humans [@krupp2018]. In unequal environments, individuals are more likely to resort to risky, hostile, and criminal activities in desperate attempts to compete for otherwise inaccessible positions and resources [@mishra2015]. The impact of inequality on individual decision-making likewise manifests through higher nation-level homicide rates [@daly2016], increased gambling [@payne2017], consumer debt [@christen2005], and reduced cooperation [@burton-chellew2013 ; @anderson2008].

The relative state model [@mishra2017] posits that individuals take risks not only to escape material destitution, but also to keep up with competitors. As a result, risk-taking can be influenced by social comparisons. As wealth distributions become more skewed, so do comparison standards. Under conditions of inequality, individuals set more ambitious goals, and subsequently take more risks, as they try to close the gap between their current state and their aspiration levels [@payne2017]. Likewise, being worse off than others can lead to emotional responses of envy and personal relative deprivation, which can be linked to gambling as well as spiteful behaviours [@callan2008]. Likewise, inequality leads to feelings of envy and spiteful behaviours [@wobker2015].

Given the evidence for inequality's effect on feelings of disadvantage and risk-taking, we hypothesize that people expect envious and dissatisfied reactions from peers following cues of economic disparities. Effective social behaviour should acknowledge the power of emotions to mobilize behaviour. For instance, in the two-player ultimatum game, Proposers most often offer 50% of an endowment to their partner. About half of Responders reject proposals less than 20% of the total resource, causing both parties to get nothing [reviewed in @camerer2011].

Such generosity in the ultimatum game is in the proposer's approximate self-interest [FRANK?]. A payoff-maximizing Proposer might be tempted to offer the smallest nonzero sum possible, expecting the Responder to accept a profitable transaction. However, if the Responder is likely to reject profitable, but unequal offers, then a proposer's best chance to get any money is to offer an equal split of the funds. By failing to anticipate inequality aversion in their partner, actors would often have their offer rejected and obtain *worse* outcomes. Given that interpersonal security measures are specifically designed to deter antagonistic social partners, decision-makers must consider others' intentions when deciding whether to purchase security goods. Specifically, this project will examine whether the presence of economic inequality heightens participants' expectations of antagonism from their partners, and subsequently participants' willingness to engage in security consumption.

This theory of envy anticipation makes similar directional predictions as some existing theories of distrust (e.g., theories on opportunity costs), but makes these predictions under more generalized circumstances. Even when individuals are not in absolute poverty, not offered larger material incentives for antisocial behaviour, or not facing different opportunity costs, we would still predict that inequality would foster distrust and security consumption.

### Proposed sample characteristics

### experimental procedures

#### The security game

Economic games examining self-protection are not new. Most notably, @mcevily2012 devised a behavioural distrust game, whereby participants choose whether to incur a cost that guarantees that their partner splits a surplus income equally. Compared to the distrust game, the security game is explicitly probabilistic - partners have risky choice to take funds for themselves, and security expenditures reduce the probability of successful "attacks."

A pretest of n=`r pretest_initial_n` participants was conducted to find which game configurations that had a favourable distribution, while avoiding ceiling/floor effects. This project will use values from the 50_02 condition, which corresponds to a baseline 50% chance of successful thefts, and each unit of security costing \$0.02. This condition seems to produce the least skewed data, at `r round(base_skew,2)`.

## Multilevel Analysis of the International Crime Victimization Survey

**The Methods section in Letters and Articles should ideally not exceed 3,000 words but may be longer if necessary**

Atkinson and Brandolini (2001) discuss these and several related pitfalls in their excellent survey on the use of secondary data sets in studies of income inequality.

The relationship between country-level inequality and the consumption of security products will be tested using a multilevel linear regression. This analysis will be accomplished using a combination of three archival datasets.

Firstly, indicators of security consumption have been accessed from the International Crime Victimization survey [ICVS, @vankesteren2010], which is an accumulation of standardized sample surveys to look at householders' experiences with crime, policing, crime prevention and feelings of unsafety. Although it does not consist of longitudinal observations, the ICVS has been distributed across five phases over fifteen years (1989, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2005), surveying over 300,000 people across 78 different countries . For the purposes of this study, it is most notable that this survey contains items such as respondents' adopted measures to protect themselves against burglary.

Secondly, nation-level inequality in disposable income was accessed through the Standardized World Income Inequality Database [SWIID, @solt2020]. The SWIID has been designed to maximize the comparability of income inequality data while maintaining the widest possible coverage across countries and over time. As a result, the gini coefficients are accompanied by standard errors to reflect uncertainty in the estimates.

Lastly, countries' expenditure-side real GDP was retrieved from the Penn World Table, version 10.0 (PWT). The selected GDP values are adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, "to compare relative living standards across countries at a single point in time" [@feenstra2015]. Nations' GDP values were divided by their population sizes to yield a per-capita GDP value, which will be used for these analysis.

### Proposed sample characteristics

Although the above datasets extend across multiple years, the current analysis will be limited to observations across 2004-2006. Imposing this restriction yields a sufficient initial number of cases `r format(sweep5_nrow, big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` and countries `r sweep5_countries`, combined with relative recency of data.

### Inclusion/exclusion criteria (e.g., outliers)

Since the ICVS, SWIID, and PWT are publicly available, preprocessing and inclusion/exclusion steps have already been implemented, and are available in the sourced and attached code. Some notable preprocessing steps are as follows:

1.  merged ICVS responses from United Kingdom, England & Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland into a single cluster of "United Kingdom," as SWIID and PWT values are not available for these portions of the UK.

2.  Excluded participants who refused response on any measures

3.  Excluded four countries that had missing responses on key predictor and outcome measures: Switzerland, Hong Kong, Estonia, and Japan

4.  Averaged gini and gdp values across 2004-2006 into a single index

After a conservative exclusion process for missing data, survey sweeps conducted across 2004-6 yielded `r sum(summary(iv_2005$country)>0)` countries and a total `r format(nrow(iv_2005), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` participants, with a minimum of `r min(summary(iv_2005$country)[summary(iv_2005$country)!= 0])` participants per country. An exclusion strategy maximizing the number of variables yields `r sum(summary(iv_2005_mod$country)>0)` countries, and `r format(nrow(iv_2005_mod), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` participants.

### Measurement and variables

Security consumption have been operationalized as a count variable, summing respondents' self-reported ownership of five different preventative measures: a burglar alarm, special door locks, special grills, a high perimeter fence, and caretaker security. This count variable excludes several prevention variables due to missing data, such as owning a watch dog, having surveillance arrangements with neighbors, and purchasing insurance against criminal activities.

#### Predictor variables

**For frequentist analysis plans, the a priori power must be 0.95 or higher for all proposed hypothesis tests.**

We used r package SuperPower for our power analyses

In the case of highly uncertain effect sizes, a variable sample size and interim data analysis is permissible but with inspection points stated in advance,
